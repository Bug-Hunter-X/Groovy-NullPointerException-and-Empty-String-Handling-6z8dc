This repository demonstrates a common Groovy error related to null and empty string handling. The `bug.groovy` file showcases a method that attempts to handle null and empty string inputs but might still throw exceptions. The `bugSolution.groovy` file provides a corrected version that uses the `elvis operator` and the `?.` safe navigation operator to improve error handling and null safety.
